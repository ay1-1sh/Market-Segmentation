## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### 🏃‍♀️ Running the Application

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the prerequisites mentioned above
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project
4. Run the following command to start the Flask application:
python app.py

5. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

### 💻 Architecture

The web application is built using Flask, a Python web framework. The user interface is designed using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the server-side scripts are written in Python. The data processing is done using Pandas, and the machine learning algorithms are implemented using Scikit-learn.

### 📈 Algorithm

The web application implements K-means clustering algorithm to segment the customers based on their purchasing behavior. The number of clusters can be selected by the user. The results are displayed in a scatter plot, which can be downloaded as a PNG file.

### 🌟 Features

- Upload CSV file
- Select relevant features
- Choose the number of clusters
- Download the scatter plot as a PNG file

### 🎨 UI/UX

The user interface is designed using Bootstrap and custom CSS. The application uses jQuery for dynamic content loading and AJAX requests.
